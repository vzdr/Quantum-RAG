Parkinson's disease involves progressive degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in substantia nigra. Classic triad includes resting tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. Postural instability develops later. Symptoms begin asymmetrically. Levodopa therapy improves motor symptoms but doesn't stop progression.
