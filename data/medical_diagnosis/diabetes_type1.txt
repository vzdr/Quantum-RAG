Type 1 diabetes results from autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells. Blood glucose rises uncontrolled without insulin. Symptoms include excessive thirst, frequent urination, unexplained weight loss, and fatigue. Diagnosis shows elevated blood glucose and often positive autoantibodies. Treatment requires lifelong insulin replacement.
