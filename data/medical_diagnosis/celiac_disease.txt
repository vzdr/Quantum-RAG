Celiac disease is an immune reaction to gluten protein in wheat, barley, and rye. Small intestine lining becomes damaged, impairing nutrient absorption. Symptoms include diarrhea, bloating, weight loss, and fatigue. Diagnosis requires positive antibody tests and intestinal biopsy showing villous atrophy. Strict gluten-free diet allows intestinal healing.
