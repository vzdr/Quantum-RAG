Cushing's syndrome results from excess cortisol exposure. Central obesity, moon face, buffalo hump, and purple striae develop. Hypertension, diabetes, and osteoporosis occur. Muscle weakness and fatigue are common. Diagnosis requires 24-hour urine cortisol, late-night salivary cortisol, or dexamethasone suppression testing.
