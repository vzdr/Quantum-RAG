Type Aliases
------------

The following type aliases are defined for clarity and type safety:

* ``Matrix`` - A 2D NumPy array with shape (n,n) for square matrices
* ``Vector`` - A 1D NumPy array with shape (n,) for vectors
* ``Bit`` - A literal type restricted to values 0 or 1

These types are used throughout the simulator components to ensure type safety and clear documentation of expected data structures.
